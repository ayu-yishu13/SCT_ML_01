  ##House Price Prediction

This project predicts house sale prices using machine learning, based on data from Kaggle’s House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. It implements a complete pipeline from exploratory data analysis to model training and final predictions.

🔹 Project Overview
Goal: Predict SalePrice based on various features like number of rooms, square footage, neighborhood, etc.

Data: The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables describing aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

scikit-learn

LightGBM (for model improvement)
